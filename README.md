# Risk

A lisp-like language in Rust. Use at your own risk.

## Purpose

This is mostly a learning project for me to learn both:

- Rust
- Language design

Expect lots of bugs, weird implementation decisions, and an unstable API.
Hopefully in the future those won't be expectations.

While this is just a learning project, I _do_ want this to be a usable and
convenient languages. Some of the goals are:

- A few rust builtins as possibile
- Risk native implementations of the majority of the standard library
- Useful and convenient std library

## Install

Right now, just clone this repo and `cargo run` - will eventually be on
[crates.io](https://crates.io) for install.

## Documentation

Nonexistent right now - on the todo list.
